 CHECK THE STRUCTURE CAREFULLY FOR:

 - EXTREMELY LARGE STIFFNESS PROPERTIES, OR
 - BUCKLING DUE TO P-DELTA OR GEOMETRIC NONLINEARITY, OR

 TO OBTAIN FURTHER INFORMATION:
 - USE THE STANDARD SOLVER, OR
 - RUN AN EIGEN ANALYSIS USING AUTO FREQUENCY SHIFTING (WITH
   ADDITIONAL MASS IF NEEDED) AND INVESTIGATE THE MODE SHAPES
